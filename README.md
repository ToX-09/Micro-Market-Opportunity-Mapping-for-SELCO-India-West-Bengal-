**By Arkajyoti Sarkar | Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (MAKAUT)**

## Overview

This is an independently developed, data-driven consulting project focused on identifying high-impact rural districts in **West Bengal** for decentralized solar energy deployment. The analysis was inspired by the mission and work of **SELCO India** and combines real-world data, analytical modeling, and strategic insights.

The goal is to demonstrate how business analytics and public data can be used to support clean energy access and inclusive development.

## Objectives

- Evaluate rural districts in West Bengal on key indicators: energy access, poverty, literacy, and solar potential  
- Score and rank districts to identify areas of high socio-economic need and solar feasibility  
- Provide strategic, data-backed recommendations for potential interventions and partnerships

---

## Methodology

- Collected data from sources including:
  - Census of India 2011
  - Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC)
  - MNRE solar radiation maps
  - Saubhagya scheme electrification data
- Normalized all indicators using Min-Max scaling
- Developed a weighted **Opportunity Score** model
- Ranked 19 districts by final composite score
- Visualized top regions using bar charts

## Deliverables

- üìÑ **Final Report (PDF)**: A professional academic-style report using University of York formatting  
- üìì **Jupyter Notebook**: Full code, scoring logic, and analysis  
- üìÅ **CSV Dataset**: Final dataset with all normalized variables and opportunity scores  
- üìä **Bar Chart**: Top 10 high-priority districts for SELCO India  
- üó∫Ô∏è Insights specifically applicable to West Bengal

## Key Findings

Top 5 opportunity districts:
1. Maldah  
2. Purulia  
3. Uttar Dinajpur  
4. Murshidabad  
5. Bankura

These districts scored high across poverty, energy deficit, and solar feasibility, making them ideal candidates for solar livelihood pilots.
